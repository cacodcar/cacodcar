### About me

I am Rahul Kakodkar, a Phd student working with Professor Efstratios N. Pistikopoulos in the [Multiparameteric Optimization and Control (Pistikopoulos) Group](https://parametric.tamu.edu/). My research focuses on developing tools for the modeling and optimzation of energy systems under uncertainty. You can find my publications listed [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=KfIvcG4AAAAJ) and [here](https://parametric.tamu.edu/people/bio/?name=rahul) .Code that my group has made can be found [here](https://github.com/TAMUparametric). I also paint and write poetry, learn more about me on my [personal webpage](https://www.cacodcar.com/). 

### Current Open Source Projects
* [energiapy](https://github.com/TAMUparametric/energiapy) - A **Python** package for data driven decision making and risk analysis of energy systems
* [pyomo_latex](https://github.com/cacodcar/pyomo_latex) - Makes latex strings out of pyomo constraint and objective rules
* [sudoku](https://github.com/cacodcar/sudoku) - Solve sudoku with binaries, intented to be used as a tutorial

### Mog Asundi!
