### About me

I am Rahul Kakodkar, a Phd student in the [Pistikopoulos Group](https://parametric.tamu.edu/). My research focuses on developing tools for the modeling and optimzation of energy systems under uncertainty. Code that my group has made can be found [here](https://github.com/TAMUparametric). I also paint and write poetry, learn more about me
on my [personal webpage](https://www.cacodcar.com/). 

### Current Open Source Projects
* [energiapy](https://github.com/TAMUparametric/energiapy) - A **Python** package for data driven decision making and risk analysis of energy systems
* [pyomo_latex](https://github.com/cacodcar/pyomo_latex) - Makes latex strings out of pyomo constraint and objective rules
* [sudoku](https://github.com/cacodcar/sudoku) - Solve sudoku with binaries, intented to be used as a tutorial
