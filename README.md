## About me

I am Rahul Kakodkar, a post-doctoral research associate at the Texas A&M Energy Institute. 
My research focuses on developing tools for the multiscale modeling and optimization of energy systems under uncertainty. 

Visit my [personal webpage](https://www.cacodcar.com/) for more information.

## Current Open Source Projects
* [energiapy](https://github.com/TAMUparametric/energiapy) - A **Python** package for data driven decision making and risk analysis of energy systems
* [gana](https://github.com/cacodcar/gana) - An algebraic modeling language (AML) for multiscale modeling and optimization 
* [sudoku](https://github.com/cacodcar/sudoku) - Solve sudoku with binaries, intented to be used as a tutorial
* [pyomo_latex](https://github.com/cacodcar/pyomo_latex) - Makes latex strings out of pyomo constraint and objective rules
